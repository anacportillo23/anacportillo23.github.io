<h1 id="energypod-user-guide-for-virginia-tech-patrons">EnergyPod User Guide for Virginia Tech Patrons</h1>
<p>EnergyPods promote restfulness and rejuvenation for stressed and/or sleep-deprived employees through short 15-20 minute naps.</p>
<h2 id="hokies-sleep-well-campaign">Hokies Sleep Well Campaign</h2>
<p>Through <a href="https://hokiewellness.vt.edu/students/program_areas/sleep.html">Hokies Sleep Well Campaign</a>, designed to promote healthy sleep habits for Virginia Tech students—three EnergyPods were installed in various campus locations. Students who do not regularly sleep for the recommended seven to eight hours, will likely find this sleep habit detrimental—regarding both their physical and mental health, as well as their schoolwork. EnergyPods allow Hokies to squeeze in quick naps between classes to improve productivity and increase alertness. Enter, the EnergyPod at Virginia Tech.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-at-vt">The Problem at VT</h2>
<p><strong>Despite these efforts, Virginia Tech  fails to adeptly explain and provide detailed instructions for EnergyPod users.</strong> Certain features of the EnergyPod are not intuitive—leading to frequent user confusion or the misuse of EnergyPod features (which was seen firsthand by Virginia Tech students). Additionally, Hokie Wellness does not mention the EnergyPod on their website. Adding a brief instructional guide to the EnergyPod may prove beneficial for user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Users:</strong> Tired Hokies looking to recharge with a quick nap. </p>
<p><strong>Need:</strong> No physical information or instructions are available for using the EnergyPods. Virginia Tech invested $40,000 in the EnergyPods to promote student wellbeing. Students should have the knowledge on how to best use these resources.</p>

1. Use the sanitizing wipes located next to the EnergyPod and wipe down the leather chair. 
2. After the seat is dry to the touch—sit down in the EnergyPod seat. Adjust the incline and recline settings located on the i20 EnergyPod console to obtain a comfortable fit.
3. Place your belongings in the interior EnergyPod cubby.
[!Important]
Protect your valuables such as your cellphone and wallet by putting them in the interior cubby.
4. Turn the privacy shield to cover your upper body.
5. Press the green start button to begin your nap. This will begin the timer, and its default is 20 minutes. (If you want to leave the chair before the timer is up, press the red stop button twice.)</p>
<p>[!Warning]

<p>MetroNaps, the company that created the EnergyPod, is in <a href="https://pzizz.com/blog/news/pzizz-partners-with-metronaps-to-bring-great-sleep-to-the-workplace-through-nap-pods/">partnership</a> with Pzizz, the audio sleep and relaxation app, to maximize users' napping experiences. </p>
<p>According to the CEO of Pzizz, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/1/12069974/pzizz-metro-naps-psychoacoustics-sleep-energypod">Rockwell Sha</a>, their audio tracks "intelligently combines music, voiceover, and sound effects in a way that will quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you to sleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed."</p>
<p>Using Pzizz in the EnergyPods will provide users with an elevated resting experience. Three twenty-minute listening tracks are available for EnergyPod users to choose from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Tip] 
To select a track, refer to the console diagram. You need to use the button that looks like a music note. It is located in the top right area of the console.</p>

<h1 id="background-information_1">Background Information</h1>
<h2 id="creation-of-metronaps">Creation of MetroNaps</h2>
<p>In 2003, partners Christopher Lindholst and Arshad Chowdhury co-founded <a href="https://metronaps.com">MetroNaps</a>—the company that would later create the EnergyPod.  The EnergyPod is the first patented office nap chair—designed for professionals to combat workplace fatigue by efficiently napping in their office environments.  </p>
<p>MetroNaps and their revolutionary EnergyPod nap chair has found its place in <a href="https://metronaps.com">business settings</a> of "offices, hospitals, universities, and fitness centers in dozens of countries across four continents," as well as in large <a href="https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/google-uber-and-other-companies-where-you-can-nap-at-the-office.html">companies</a> including Google, Facebook, and Zappos. </p>
<p>Following suit of professional office spaces, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/7-schools-that-have-nap-stations">several colleges</a> have placed EnergyPods on their campuses to promote restfulness for students. Virginia Tech, along with Stanford University, Washington State University, University of Miami, and University of Texas A&amp;M have purchased EnergyPods for their students. </p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-the-energypod">Benefits of the EnergyPod</h2>
<p>While MetroNaps is very confident that their EnergyPod will boost both worker productivity and energy level—a study published in the <em>Future Healthcare Journal</em> has produced concurring findings. </p>
<p>The study, "Sleep is the Best Medicine: How Rest Facilities and EnergyPods Can Improve Staff Wellbeing" examines the effect an EnergyPod has on medical employees while working the night shift. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8651319/">EnergyPod</a> provides users with the benefits of healthy sleeping practices including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased energy levels and alertness</li>
<li>A quiet space to decompress from work-related stress</li>
<li>Support interdisciplinary cohesion between employees</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-college-students-nap">How Do College Students Nap?</h2>
<p>Studies demonstrated that college students regularly sleep less than the recommended amount. For adults, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898">the Mayo Clinic recommends seven hours</a> of sleep a night. </p>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4075951/">A study conducted by the University of Michigan Neurology department</a>   titled <em>Causes and Consequences of Sleepiness Among College Students,</em> revealed that "fifty percent of college students report daytime sleepiness, seventy percent obtain insufficient sleep, and eighty percent report that their studies are affected by their lack of sleep." These statistics demonstrate a need for improved sleeping habits among this demographic of college students. </p>
<p>Many college students combat their lack of regular sleep with caffeine from coffee or energy drinks—or with daytime naps.</p>

<p>The EnergyPods cost a hefty $13,000 each. Since Virginia Tech has purchased three EnergyPods, the total cost for their installation is roughly $40,000.</p>
<p>Researchers should have access to the three EnergyPods' data. Then, they could determine exact napping patterns for Hokies—including which EnergyPods are used most frequently, their most popular times for use, and the average duration of use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!Caution]
If the EnergyPod is not working, please notify a Virginia Tech employee. Please do not attempt to unplug or interact with live cables yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If an issue arises with the EnergyPod—these steps may be followed in the following manner by a designated EnergyPod technician:
1. Check the power connection. 
2. Unplug the EnergyPod's power cables from the electrical outlet.
3. Keep the EnergyPod unplugged for one minute.<br />
4. Plug the EnergyPod power cable back into the electrical outlet. </p>
<p>If the issue cannot be  identified, users should test each console function individually to determine which features are working correctly and which are not. </p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is an EnergyPod?</strong>
An EnergyPod is an ergonomic nap chair. Through its innovative features, EnergyPod provides users with an elevated resting experience in professional work settings</li>
<li><strong>Can you use an EnergyPod in an unconventional manner?</strong>
Yes. One can simply nap in an EnergyPod—using it as a traditional chair. However, the nap timer, track settings, and Pzizz sounds are designed to aid users in achieving easily accessible and refreshing naps.</li>
<li><strong>Do users need to download the Pzizz mobile app?</strong>
This action is not necessary to use the EnergyPod. However, using Pzizz at home can individuals help build better sleeping habits.</li>
<li><strong>What is the best time of the day to use an EnergyPod?</strong>
A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0013469489902460#preview-section-abstract">sleep research study</a> suggests that the optimal time for napping is from 3 p.m to 5 p.m. to reduce post-nap sleepiness.</li>
<li><strong>Can EnergyPods be adjusted for different nap durations longer than twenty minutes?</strong>
Yes. Users can nap in an EnergyPod for any duration they would like to. However, longer naps might cause grogginess—and might not be advised unless the user is very sleep deprived.</dd></li>
