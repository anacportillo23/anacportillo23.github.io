EnergyPod User Guide for Virginia Tech Patrons EnergyPods promote restfulness and rejuvenation for stressed and/or sleep-deprived employees through short 15-20 minute naps. Hokies Sleep Well Campaign Through Hokies Sleep Well Campaign , designed to promote healthy sleep habits for Virginia Tech students\u2014three EnergyPods were installed in various campus locations. Students who do not regularly sleep for the recommended seven to eight hours, will likely find this sleep habit detrimental\u2014regarding both their physical and mental health, as well as their schoolwork. EnergyPods allow Hokies to squeeze in quick naps between classes to improve productivity and increase alertness. Enter, the EnergyPod at Virginia Tech. The Problem at VT Despite these efforts, Virginia Tech fails to adeptly explain and provide detailed instructions for EnergyPod users. Certain features of the EnergyPod are not intuitive\u2014leading to frequent user confusion or the misuse of EnergyPod features (which was seen firsthand by Virginia Tech students). Additionally, Hokie Wellness does not mention the EnergyPod on their website. Adding a brief instructional guide to the EnergyPod may prove beneficial for user experience. Primary Users: Tired Hokies looking to recharge with a quick nap. Need: No physical information or instructions are available for using the EnergyPods. Virginia Tech invested $40,000 in the EnergyPods to promote student wellbeing. Students should have the knowledge on how to best use these resources.

Using a new sanitizing wipe, clean off the EnergyPod's cushion surface. EnergyPod Features Relaxation Elements Massage Vibration A vibration wakes users at the end of their session.

Cubby to Hold Personal Belongings Users are encouraged to place their valuables in the cubby, because it is included within the privacy shield's coverage while you nap. Music Tracks A student sleeping at a desk. Photo via Pexels. MetroNaps, the company that created the EnergyPod, is in partnership with Pzizz, the audio sleep and relaxation app, to maximize users' napping experiences. According to the CEO of Pzizz, Rockwell Sha , their audio tracks \"intelligently combines music, voiceover, and sound effects in a way that will quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you to sleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed.\" Using Pzizz in the EnergyPods will provide users with an elevated resting experience. Three twenty-minute listening tracks are available for EnergyPod users to choose from. [!Tip] To select a track, refer to the console diagram. You need to use the button that looks like a music note. It is located in the top right area of the console. Track 1 by EnergyPod This is the default track when you press the \"Select Music Track\" button one time. Track 1 has the most energetic piano instrumentals. Track 2 by Pzizz This is the track when you press the \"Select Music Track\" button twice. If you have already pressed it once to start playing Track 1, then you only need to press it one more time. This track includes the most musical composition. It has marimba tones and string instrumentals, as well as wave noise and seagulls later on. Track 3 by Pzizz This is the track when you press the \"Select Music Track\" button three times. If you have already pressed it twice to start playing Track 2, then you only need to press it one more time. Online, this includes track rain noise and soothing ringing marimba tones, as well as a guided meditation by a female voiceover. Found in the EnergyPod itself, the female voiceover is replaced by a guided meditation by Pzizz's male voiceover, Matthew. Background Information Creation of MetroNaps In 2003, partners Christopher Lindholst and Arshad Chowdhury co-founded MetroNaps \u2014the company that would later create the EnergyPod. The EnergyPod is the first patented office nap chair\u2014designed for professionals to combat workplace fatigue by efficiently napping in their office environments. MetroNaps and their revolutionary EnergyPod nap chair has found its place in business settings of \"offices, hospitals, universities, and fitness centers in dozens of countries across four continents,\" as well as in large companies including Google, Facebook, and Zappos. Following suit of professional office spaces, several colleges have placed EnergyPods on their campuses to promote restfulness for students. Virginia Tech, along with Stanford University, Washington State University, University of Miami, and University of Texas A&M have purchased EnergyPods for their students. Benefits of the EnergyPod While MetroNaps is very confident that their EnergyPod will boost both worker productivity and energy level\u2014a study published in the Future Healthcare Journal has produced concurring findings. The study, \"Sleep is the Best Medicine: How Rest Facilities and EnergyPods Can Improve Staff Wellbeing\" examines the effect an EnergyPod has on medical employees while working the night shift. The EnergyPod provides users with the benefits of healthy sleeping practices including: Increased energy levels and alertness A quiet space to decompress from work-related stress Support interdisciplinary cohesion between employees How Do College Students Nap? Studies demonstrated that college students regularly sleep less than the recommended amount. For adults, the Mayo Clinic recommends seven hours of sleep a night. A study conducted by the University of Michigan Neurology department titled Causes and Consequences of Sleepiness Among College Students, revealed that \"fifty percent of college students report daytime sleepiness, seventy percent obtain insufficient sleep, and eighty percent report that their studies are affected by their lack of sleep.\" These statistics demonstrate a need for improved sleeping habits among this demographic of college students. Many college students combat their lack of regular sleep with caffeine from coffee or energy drinks\u2014or with daytime naps. This graphic describes the times of day during the week that college students are most likely to nap. Future Considerations The EnergyPods cost a hefty $13,000 each. Since Virginia Tech has purchased three EnergyPods, the total cost for their installation is roughly $40,000. Researchers should have access to the three EnergyPods' data. Then, they could determine exact napping patterns for Hokies\u2014including which EnergyPods are used most frequently, their most popular times for use, and the average duration of use. Additional Support EnergyPod Troubleshooting [!Caution] If the EnergyPod is not working, please notify a Virginia Tech employee. Please do not attempt to unplug or interact with live cables yourself. If an issue arises with the EnergyPod\u2014these steps may be followed in the following manner by a designated EnergyPod technician: 1. Check the power connection. 2. Unplug the EnergyPod's power cables from the electrical outlet. 3. Keep the EnergyPod unplugged for one minute. 4. Plug the EnergyPod power cable back into the electrical outlet. If the issue cannot be identified, users should test each console function individually to determine which features are working correctly and which are not. If the issue with the EnergyPod persists, contact MetroNaps for direct support. A MetroNaps technician can assist with EnergyPod issues. FAQs What is an EnergyPod?
