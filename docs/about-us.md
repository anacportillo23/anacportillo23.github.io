# Our Team
We are a group of Virginia Tech students who experienced the lack of knowledge around EnergyPods on campus first-hand, in Spring 2025.

Through this project, we gained valuable skills, such as how to write in the Markdown coding language (similar to HTML, but easier), as well as how to utilize GitHub.
