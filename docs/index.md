EnergyPods promote restfulness and rejuvenation for stressed and/or sleep-deprived employees through short 15-20 minute naps. Virginia Tech provides access to EnergyPods in three campus locations. This guide helps students use the EnergyPods properly.

## Hokies Sleep Well Campaign  
Through [Hokies Sleep Well Campaign](https://hokiewellness.vt.edu/students/program_areas/sleep.html), designed to promote healthy sleep habits for Virginia Tech students, the university installed three EnergyPods in various campus locations. Students who do not regularly sleep for the recommended seven to eight hours, will likely find this sleep habit detrimental—regarding both their physical and mental health, as well as their schoolwork. EnergyPods allow Hokies to squeeze in quick naps between classes to improve productivity and increase alertness. Enter, the EnergyPod at Virginia Tech.

## The Problem at VT

**Despite these efforts, Virginia Tech  fails to adequately explain and provide detailed instructions for EnergyPod users.** Certain features of the EnergyPod are not intuitive—leading to frequent user confusion or the misuse of EnergyPod features (which we witnessed firsthand when writing the guide). Additionally, Hokie Wellness does not mention the EnergyPod on their website. Adding a brief instructional guide to the EnergyPod may prove beneficial for user experience.

**Primary Users:** Tired Hokies looking to recharge with a quick nap. 

**Need:** No physical how-to infographics exist for using the EnergyPods. Most current users overlook the additional functions due to the lack of instructions on the machine. Virginia Tech invested $40,000 in the EnergyPods to promote student wellbeing. Students should have the knowledge on how to best use these resources.

> Protect your valuables such as your cellphone and wallet by putting them in the interior cubby.

1. Turn the privacy shield to cover your upper body.
2. Press the green start button to begin your nap. This will begin the timer, and its default is 20 minutes. (If you want to leave the chair before the timer is up, press the red stop button twice.)

> !!! Warning 
> If you wear contact lenses, remove your lenses before taking a nap: sleeping with contact lenses is an unsafe practice and can lead to eye dryness, irritation, and infection.

6. During the last minute of your nap gentle lights, noises, and vibrations will play to wake you up.
7. Collect your belongings before exiting the EnergyPod.
8. Using a new sanitizing wipe, clean off the EnergyPod's cushion surface. 
 

## EnergyPod Features


### Relaxation Elements

* **Massage Vibration**
A vibration wakes users at the end of their session. 
* **Changing Lights**
LED lights, such as orange and light blue, will change throughout the different music tracks (see below). They will reflect off the privacy shield.
* **Headphone Connection**
If your headphones or earbuds have a plug-in jack, you can connect them to the console.
* **Nap Timer (Shown on LED Display)**
The nap timer defaults to 20 minutes.
* **Recline and Incline**
Users can adjust the EnergyPod to lower or raise the bottom end of the chair where your feet are. This contributes to EnergyPod's ergonomic design as cited in their documentation.
* **Cubby to Hold Personal Belongings**
Users are encouraged to place their valuables in the cubby, because it is included within the privacy shield's coverage while you nap.

MetroNaps, the company that created the EnergyPod, is in [partnership](https://pzizz.com/blog/news/pzizz-partners-with-metronaps-to-bring-great-sleep-to-the-workplace-through-nap-pods/) with Pzizz, the audio sleep and relaxation app, to maximize users' napping experiences. 

According to the CEO of Pzizz, [Rockwell Sha](https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/1/12069974/pzizz-metro-naps-psychoacoustics-sleep-energypod), their audio tracks "intelligently combines music, voiceover, and sound effects in a way that will quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you to sleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed."

Using Pzizz in the EnergyPods will provide users with an elevated resting experience. Three twenty-minute listening tracks are available for EnergyPod users to choose from.

> !!! Tip 
> To select a track, refer to the console diagram. You need to use the button that looks like a music note. It is located in the top right area of the console.

### Track 1 by EnergyPod
This is the default track when you press the "Select Music Track" button **one time.** Track 1 has the most energetic piano instrumentals.

# Background Information

## Creation of MetroNaps
In 2003, partners Christopher Lindholst and Arshad Chowdhury co-founded [MetroNaps](https://metronaps.com)—the company that would later create the EnergyPod.  The EnergyPod is the first patented office nap chair—designed for professionals to combat workplace fatigue by efficiently napping in their office environments.  

MetroNaps and their revolutionary EnergyPod nap chair has found its place in [business settings](https://metronaps.com) of "offices, hospitals, universities, and fitness centers in dozens of countries across four continents," as well as in large [companies](https://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/google-uber-and-other-companies-where-you-can-nap-at-the-office.html) including Google, Facebook, and Zappos. 

Following suit of professional office spaces, [several colleges](https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/7-schools-that-have-nap-stations) have placed EnergyPods on their campuses to promote restfulness for students. Virginia Tech, along with Stanford University, Washington State University, University of Miami, and University of Texas A&M have purchased EnergyPods for their students. 

## Benefits of the EnergyPod
While MetroNaps is very confident that their EnergyPod will boost both worker productivity and energy level—a study published in the *Future Healthcare Journal* has produced concurring findings. 

The study, "Sleep is the Best Medicine: How Rest Facilities and EnergyPods Can Improve Staff Wellbeing" examines the effect an EnergyPod has on medical employees while working the night shift. 

The [EnergyPod](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8651319/) provides users with the benefits of healthy sleeping practices including:

* Increased energy levels and alertness
* A quiet space to decompress from work-related stress
* Support interdisciplinary cohesion between employees

## How Do College Students Nap?
Studies demonstrated that college students regularly sleep less than the recommended amount. For adults, [the Mayo Clinic recommends seven hours](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898) of sleep a night. 

[A study conducted by the University of Michigan Neurology department](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4075951/)   titled *Causes and Consequences of Sleepiness Among College Students,* revealed that "fifty percent of college students report daytime sleepiness, seventy percent obtain insufficient sleep, and eighty percent report that their studies are affected by their lack of sleep." These statistics demonstrate a need for improved sleeping habits among this demographic of college students. 

Many college students combat their lack of regular sleep with caffeine from coffee or energy drinks—or with daytime naps.



![College Student Nap Statistics](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5e6b/9378669/0eb13a186c48/nihms-1807696-f0001.jpg)

This graphic describes the times of day during the week that college students are most likely to nap.

## Future Considerations

The EnergyPods cost a hefty $13,000 each. Since Virginia Tech has purchased three EnergyPods, the total cost for their installation is roughly $40,000.

Researchers should have access to the three EnergyPods' data. Then, they could determine exact napping patterns for Hokies—including which EnergyPods are used most frequently, their most popular times for use, and the average duration of use.

## EnergyPod Troubleshooting

> !!! Caution
> If the EnergyPod is not working, please notify a Virginia Tech employee. Please do not attempt to unplug or interact with live cables yourself.

If an issue arises with the EnergyPod—these steps may be followed in the following manner by a designated EnergyPod technician:
1. Check the power connection. 
2. Unplug the EnergyPod's power cables from the electrical outlet.
3. Keep the EnergyPod unplugged for one minute.  
4. Plug the EnergyPod power cable back into the electrical outlet. 

If the issue cannot be  identified, users should test each console function individually to determine which features are working correctly and which are not.
